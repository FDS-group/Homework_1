# FDS_homework_1

The structure of the code is as follows:

- **Filtering**: Code for question 1
- **Identification**: Code for questions 2, 3 and 4, respecting the original structure
- **tests**: Basic tests performed over the code
- **Reports**: Here you can find a single report with the answers to all the required questions. We apologize beforehand for the format. Our intention was to download everything as a latex file from Jupyter Notebook but we had issues and were not able to solve before the deadline.
